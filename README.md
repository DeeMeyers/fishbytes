## Description

My final group project for Momentum Learning. Fishbytes is a progressive web app that helps you identify and keep track of the fish you catch in North Carolina freshwaters. Currently there are details for Falls and Jordan lake with identification support for Jordan Lake. 

Taking advatange of django, python, javascript, precaching, and a mapping api, Fishbytes pulls from everything we have learned and more and brings it together in a nice, clean package.
